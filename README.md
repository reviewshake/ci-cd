# ci-cd

Reusable (Composite) Github Actions for Shake CI/CD pipelines

File name should be action.yml or action.yaml

For details see [this info](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)

## Goal

The purpose of this action is to standardize the Shake CI/CD pipelines avoiding code duplication and enforcing these features:

* Include a branch protection rule to only allow merging of code to main via Pull Requests.
* Force the approval of each Pull Request by at least one user in the CODEOWNERS file.
* Automated update of CHANGELOG file based on the body of the Pull Request.
* Automatically create a Release with the next semver version based on Pull Requests tags.
* Scans reporitory to check if there are credentials stored as plain text.

## Client Repo Configuration

Add the following labels to the client repo (the repo that uses this action):

- release-major
- release-minor
- release-patch

These labels can be used to tag a Pull Request before merging it into main branch so we can choose how to increase the semantic version

## PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN repo

This action requires passing a variable named inputs.github-token.

That token is the value of the organizational secret PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN, provided by each client pipeline using this composite action.

That secret was generated by creating a Personal Access Token for the `shake-robot` GitHub user. These are the scopes required:

- repo (so it's able to clone any repos like ci-cd or k8s-manifests repo)
- write:packages (so it can create a new GitHub release or even push a docker image to the GitHub registry)

Please set Expiration to Never.

NOTE: For details see [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps)

Please store this token in 1password, in the `Infrastructure` vault, in the `shake-robot GitHub User Personal Access Token` login

## Testing

Please use the [ci-cd-test](https://github.com/reviewshake/ci-cd-test) repo to test modifications to this action.
